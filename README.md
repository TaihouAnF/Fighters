# About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

This is a repository for the game called **Fighter** developed by using Unity. 
- The game itself is inspired by Raiden Fighters.

Why am I doing this:
* I have some games made already and I want to create some tiny demos on my own. ðŸŽ²
* I'd also like to apply some design patterns when developing, it sounds interesting. A fresh start game is always good for experimenting. ðŸ“–
* I like to use Unity for practice although they had some bad news this year.
* I just want to create some games at my own pace. I found game jams are fun (I already did some) but I want to have something done w/out having an actual due date. ðŸ˜„

As you can see, this will be an ongoing project and will grow continuously as I learn more.

## Built With

*  C#
